# Robin's Basic React Website

This is something like the bare minimum required for a website to be built in React.

## Prerequisites

You need to have **node** installed.

You will need to run

```sh
npm i
```

to install all the node packages.

## How to

You can run the site locally by running

```sh
npm start
```

If you open `./index.html` in the browser, it will load the script,
and with it the site itself.
